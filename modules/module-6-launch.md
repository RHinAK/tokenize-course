## Lesson 6.1: The Whitepaper

Your whitepaper is the single most important document for your token. It's your prospectus, pitch deck, and technical spec rolled into one.

### Whitepaper Structure

**1. Executive Summary (1 page)**
- What you're tokenizing
- The problem you're solving
- Total raise / token supply
- Team credentials

**2. Market Opportunity (2-3 pages)**
- Industry size and growth
- Current inefficiencies
- How tokenization improves the market
- Competitive landscape

**3. Token Design (2-3 pages)**
- Token properties (from your Token Spec)
- Supply and distribution plan
- Token utility / rights
- Economic model

**4. Technology (1-2 pages)**
- Why XRPL
- Smart features used (freeze, clawback, etc.)
- Security architecture
- Integration with existing systems

**5. Legal Framework (1-2 pages)**
- Regulatory classification
- Chosen exemption
- Compliance controls
- Jurisdiction

**6. Team (1 page)**
- Founders and key team
- Advisors
- Legal counsel
- Auditors

**7. Roadmap (1 page)**
- Phase 1: Development and legal
- Phase 2: Private sale / testnet
- Phase 3: Mainnet launch
- Phase 4: Growth and distribution

**8. Risk Factors (1-2 pages)**
- Market risks
- Regulatory risks
- Technology risks
- Liquidity risks

### Whitepaper Tips
- **Keep it under 20 pages** — nobody reads 50-page whitepapers
- **Lead with the business case**, not the technology
- **Use charts and visuals** — especially for token distribution
- **Have it reviewed by your attorney** before publishing
- **Include a clear disclaimer** about risks

## Lesson 6.2: Community Building

### Before Launch (4-8 weeks)

**Discord server:**
- Create channels: #announcements, #general, #questions, #token-updates
- Post regular updates (2-3 per week)
- Host AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions
- Goal: 500+ members before launch

**Twitter/X presence:**
- Post about your industry's tokenization opportunity
- Share educational content about XRPL
- Engage with XRPL community accounts
- Thread format works best for complex topics
- Goal: 1,000+ followers before launch

**Email list:**
- Landing page with email capture
- Weekly newsletter with project updates
- Early access / whitelist for subscribers
- Goal: 250+ subscribers before launch

### Community Engagement Rules
1. **Transparency first** — Share good news AND challenges
2. **Never promise returns** — This is a securities violation
3. **Respond quickly** — Active team = trustworthy project
4. **Educate, don't hype** — Build understanding, not FOMO
5. **Compliance always** — Your attorney should review public statements

## Lesson 6.3: Marketing Your Token

### Content Strategy

| Week | Content Type | Topic |
|------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | Blog post | "Why We're Tokenizing [Industry]" |
| 2 | Twitter thread | "How [Asset] Tokenization Works" |
| 3 | Video/AMA | "Meet the Team Behind [Token]" |
| 4 | Whitepaper | Full release |
| 5 | Case study | "Projecting Returns for Token Holders" |
| 6 | Launch announcement | "Token Sale is Live" |

### Channels That Work for Token Projects
1. **XRPL community** — XRP Army is massive and engaged
2. **Twitter/X** — #XRP, #XRPL, #RWA, #Tokenization hashtags
3. **Reddit** — r/xrp, r/cryptocurrency, r/realestateinvesting
4. **YouTube** — Educational content about your project
5. **LinkedIn** — If targeting business/institutional investors
6. **Podcasts** — Guest spots on crypto and industry-specific shows

### Paid Marketing (If Budget Allows)
- **XRPL ecosystem sponsorships** — Community newsletters, events
- **Google Ads** — Target "tokenize real estate" type searches
- **LinkedIn Ads** — Target accredited investors by job title/income
- **Podcast ads** — Crypto-focused shows

## Lesson 6.4: DEX Listing on XRPL

XRPL has a built-in decentralized exchange. Your token can be traded immediately — no Uniswap or CEX listing needed.

### Creating Initial Liquidity

```
1. Set a starting price (e.g., 1 TOKEN = 2 XRP)
2. Create sell offers at your starting price
3. Consider creating a spread of offers at different prices
4. Monitor and adjust based on demand
```

### Liquidity Depth Strategy

| Price (XRP) | Tokens Available | Purpose |
|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| 2.00 | 10,000 | Initial price |
| 2.10 | 20,000 | Light demand |
| 2.25 | 50,000 | Growing demand |
| 2.50 | 100,000 | Strong demand |

This creates a natural price discovery curve.

### AMM (Automated Market Maker)
XRPL now supports native AMM pools. Consider:
- Creating an AMM pool with your token + XRP
- This provides constant liquidity
- Earn trading fees from the pool
- More capital-efficient than order book offers
