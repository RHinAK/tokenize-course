## Lesson 1.1: What Is Tokenization?

Tokenization is the process of creating a digital representation of a real-world asset on a blockchain. Think of it like a digital deed — it proves ownership, can be transferred instantly, and can be divided into smaller pieces.

### Traditional vs. Tokenized Assets

| Feature | Traditional | Tokenized |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Transfer time | Days to weeks | 3-5 seconds |
| Transfer cost | $500-50,000+ | Under $0.01 |
| Minimum investment | Often $10,000+ | As low as $1 |
| Trading hours | Business hours only | 24/7/365 |
| Geographic limits | Local/national | Global |
| Intermediaries needed | 3-7 parties | 0-1 party |

### What Can Be Tokenized?
- **Real estate** — Commercial buildings, rental properties, land
- **Commodities** — Gold, silver, oil, agricultural products
- **Business equity** — LLC membership interests, stock
- **Debt instruments** — Bonds, promissory notes, receivables
- **Intellectual property** — Patents, royalty streams, music rights
- **Physical assets** — Vehicles, equipment, art, collectibles

## Lesson 1.2: Why XRPL?

The XRP Ledger is uniquely suited for tokenization because:

1. **Built-in token support** — No smart contracts needed. Token creation is a native ledger feature.
2. **Near-zero fees** — ~$0.0002 per transaction. Compare to Ethereum's $5-50.
3. **3-second settlement** — Transactions are final in 3-5 seconds.
4. **Built-in DEX** — Every token can be traded on the native decentralized exchange.
5. **Carbon neutral** — No mining. Consensus uses minimal energy.
6. **Institutional adoption** — Banks, money transmitters, and governments already use XRPL.
7. **Regulatory clarity emerging** — Ripple's legal battles have established precedent.

### XRPL vs. Other Chains for Tokenization

| Feature | XRPL | Ethereum | Solana | Polygon |
|---------|------|----------|--------|---------|
| Token creation | Native | Smart contract | Smart contract | Smart contract |
| Transaction fee | ~$0.0002 | $5-50 | $0.01 | $0.01 |
| Settlement time | 3-5 sec | 12-15 sec | 0.4 sec | 2 sec |
| Built-in DEX | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Smart contracts | Hooks (coming) | Solidity | Rust | Solidity |
| Compliance tools | Native | Third-party | Third-party | Third-party |

## Lesson 1.3: The Market Opportunity

### By the Numbers
- **$41.9 trillion** — Projected tokenized asset market by 2032 (BCG)
- **$16 trillion** — Projected tokenized securities by 2030 (McKinsey)
- **$1.5 trillion** — Current tokenized asset market (2025)
- **30%** — Projected annual growth rate for RWA tokenization

### Who's Already Doing This?
- **BlackRock** — BUIDL fund ($500M+ tokenized Treasury bonds on Ethereum)
- **JPMorgan** — Onyx platform for tokenized collateral
- **Goldman Sachs** — Digital Asset Platform for tokenized bonds
- **Franklin Templeton** — Tokenized money market fund
- **Singapore government** — Project Guardian for institutional DeFi

### The First-Mover Advantage
Most small and mid-size businesses haven't heard of tokenization yet. By the time they have, the early adopters will already be positioned. This course puts you 3-5 years ahead of the curve.
